# polyfill service

The polyfill service is part of the environment boilerplate

It's set within the standard service scaffolding, and uses the 
`polyfill-service` module which is the module behind http://polyfill.io

This allows us to self-host a service that delivers the correct 
polyfill payload depending on the browser feature set.
